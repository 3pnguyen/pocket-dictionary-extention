## ✨ About the project

A simple Chrome extention that you can use as a dictionary. It uses the "Dicationary by API-Ninjas" API from RapidAPI for the word definitions. First web-development project w/ HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The project was made very quickly, so therefore it is also very basic and could easily be impropved. That could be something to do later...
